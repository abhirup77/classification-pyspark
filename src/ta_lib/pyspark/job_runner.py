"""Joblib based job runner.

We shall assume each pipeline module will provide a function to create a
plan (``create_job_plan``) and a ``task_runner`` function to execute tasks.

The data structures are as follows:
    * A ``Job Plan`` is simply a list of stages.
    * A ``Stage`` is a list of tasks.
    * A ``Task`` is a dictionary with information reqd. for the task.
